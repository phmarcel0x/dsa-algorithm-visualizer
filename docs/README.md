### Introduction

The Modular Algorithm Rendering System is a personal project developed to visualize classic sorting and searching algorithms. It serves as a dynamic tool to demonstrate how different algorithms approach the task of organizing and finding elements within randomly generated lists.

### Features

- **Interactive Visualizations:** See sorting and searching algorithms in action with real-time animations.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easily select algorithms and adjust speed parameter to understand their behavior on different datasets.
- **Educational Resource:** Enhances understanding of algorithm efficiency and complexity through direct observation and comparison.

### How to Use

1. Select an algorithm from the available options (more coming soon)!
2. Chose a dataset size and randomise the datum.
3. Adjust visualization speed according to your preference.
4. Click 'Visualize!' to start the animation and observe the algorithm at work.
<!-- 5. Utilize the provided descriptions to gain insights into each algorithm's strategy and use case. -->
